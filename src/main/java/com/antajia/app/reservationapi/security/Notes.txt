To add security, we need to:
1. add dependencies: spring-boot-starter-security and jjwt
2. Create JWT Filter class and SecurityConfig
3. Create Model, Dto and controller for Login and User (also generate the tables required)
3. Secure endpoints with Web Security and allow login endpoints
4. Implement usage of UserDetailsService and SecurityConfig
5. Test the encryption (ex. BCryptPasswordEncoder)
